Here in this module we learn about how to use useState()

Hereâ€™s an explanation of `useState()` in React JS tailored for two different audiences:

### **For a Technical Fresher:**

`useState()` is a React Hook used to manage state in a functional component. It allows you to create state variables that React can track and update dynamically, without needing class components.

- **Syntax:** `const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);`
    - `state`: The current value of the state.
    - `setState`: A function to update the state.
    - `initialValue`: The initial value of the state.

React will re-render the component whenever the state is updated using `setState`.

#### **Example**:
Imagine youâ€™re building a "like" button for a post. You need to track how many times the button is clicked. Using `useState`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0); // Initial state is 0

  const handleLike = () => {
    setLikes(likes + 1); // Update the state
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleLike}>Like</button>
      <p>{likes} likes</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default LikeButton;
```

- Every time you click the "Like" button, `setLikes` updates the `likes` state, and the UI re-renders to show the new count.

### **For Non-Coding People:**

Think of `useState()` as a way to keep track of things that can change in an app, like a digital counter or a switch.

#### **Real-Life Analogy**:
Imagine youâ€™re managing a voting machine at an event. Initially, the vote count is **0**. Every time someone presses the "Vote" button, you increase the count by 1, and you also show the updated count on a display screen.

In the app, `useState()` is like the system keeping track of the votes and updating the display screen whenever someone votes.

#### **Example in Plain Words**:
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re using a shopping app, and you add items to your cart. The cart icon updates the number of items youâ€™ve added. That number is managed using `useState()`. If you start with 0 items and add 1, the state changes to 1, and the app updates the display to show "1 item in the cart."
